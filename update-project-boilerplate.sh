----- BEFORE CONTINUING:
- CHECK IF THE UPDATE DIDN'T FAILED HALFWAY:
  - Make sure the current git repository is again pointing to your project's repository and NOT to the boilerplate repository.
    - You can do this by running 'git remote' and checking that there is no remote called 'boilerplate'
    - IF YOU DID A FORCED UPDATE and it failed:
      - Delete the '.git/' directory (in the project's root directory) and restore this same directory with the one named '.git-bkp/'.
- If there were any conflicts, pick the updates you want to add to the project.
- Run 'npm run install:all' to update the 'package-lock.json' files with the dependencies changes.
- Run 'git add .' to stage all the accepted updates.
- If you did a normal update, run 'git merge --continue'. If you did a forced update using the '-f' flag, commit the update with 'git commit' as you would do with normal changes
    IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG in a normal update, you can run 'git merge --abort'.
    IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG In a forced update, just discard the changes as you normally would."

----- BEFORE CONTINUING:
- CHECK IF THE UPDATE DIDN'T FAILED HALFWAY:
  - Make sure the current git repository is again pointing to your project's repository and NOT to the boilerplate repository.
    - You can do this by running 'git remote' and checking that there is no remote called 'boilerplate'
    - If the update failed:
      - Delete the '.git/' directory in the root directory of the repository where this project is stored.
- Pick the updates you want to add to the project
- Run 'npm run install:all' to update the 'package-lock.json' files with the dependencies changes
- Commit everything as normal work"
